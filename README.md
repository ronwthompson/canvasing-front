# Getting started

Once cloned, open the project directory and run `npm i` to install the project dependencies.

Once that has completed, run `npm start` to run the app in development mode.

Open the [Splash Page](http://localhost:3000) to view the main pages in your browser. You can also go directly to each of the routes listed here:

- [Create New Note Page](http://localhost:3000/takeNotes)
- [View All Notes Page](http://localhost:3000/viewNotes)

You will also need to download and run the backend, which is located [here](https://github.com/ronwthompson/canvasing-back).
